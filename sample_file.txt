Hello!
This is my arbitrary file. 

Browser Extensible Data(BED) is the format in which liftOver needs.
Can use plink to recode to VCF format (--recode vcf)
The VCF file has as its first 3 columns CHROM POS ID
grep -v '^#' input.vcf | awk -F '\t' '{print $1,$2,$2,$3}' > output.ucsc.bed

Need to test this process.
