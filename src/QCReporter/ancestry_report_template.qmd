# Ancestry predictions

Ancestries are predicted after the initial round of QC steps. The principal components upon which the population is stratifed, are based off of the [genetic relatedness matrix (GRM)](https://zjuwhw.github.io/2021/08/20/GRM.html). The subjects are then projected onto the PC space and assigned ethnicities using k-means clustering based on either a standard genomic dataset (such as though genomes) are by the reported ancestries of the subject in the study. Figure @fig-ancestryPredictions the projection of each subject onto the first few PCs. They are colored by their reported ancestries.

The densities of ancestries based on the reference set are represent by the 10% contour lines of the 2d density plots with the observed populations presented as points over top of the densities shown in @fig-ancestryPredictions.
